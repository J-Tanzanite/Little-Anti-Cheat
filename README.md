# Little Anti-Cheat

Little Anti-Cheat is a free and open source anti-cheat for source games, and runs on SourceMod.\
It was originally developed for some secret servers I had back in the day.\
But, as I quit cheating and quit having servers, I decided to release this project to help the community out.\
This Anti-Cheat is by no means perfect, and it is bypassable to some extent, but it should still be helpful in dealing with cheaters :)

### Current Cheat Detections:
 - Angle-Cheats (Legit Anti-Backstab (TF2), Basic Anti-Aims and Duckspeed).
 - Chat-Clear (When cheaters clear the chat).
 - Basic Invalid ConVar Detector (Checks if clients have sv_cheats turned on and such).
 - BunnyHop (Bhop).
 - Basic Projectile and Hitscan Aimbot.
 - Basic Aimlock.
 - Anti-Duck-Delay/FastDuck (CS:GO only).
 - Newlines in names.

### Misc features:
 - Angle-Cheats Patch (Patches Angle-Cheats from working).
 - Max Interp Kicker (Kicks players for attempting to exploit interp (cl_interp 0.5)).
 - Max Ping Kicker (Kicks players for having too high ping (Disabled by default)).
 - Backtrack Patch (Patches backtrack cheats (Disabled by default)).
 - Macro detection.
 - Invalid name detection.
 - Invalid characters in chat patch (+ chat clear exploit fix).

### Supported Games:
 - [TF2] Team Fortress 2
 - [CS:GO] Counter-Strike:Global Offensive
 - [CS:S] Counter-Strike:Source
 - [L4D2] Left 4 Dead 2
 - [L4D] Left 4 Dead
 - [DoD:S] Day of Defeat: Source

### Untested, but should work in:
 - [HL2:DM] Half-Life 2:DeathMatch

## FAQ
**Q: What is Autoshoot?**\
A: Autoshoot is when a cheat fires a perfect 1-tick shot.\
It's quite common for cheats to do this when using aimbot.\
Autoshoot detections work by detecting 1-tick perfect shots that lead to a kill twice in a row (Autoshoot will get logged if another aimbot type was detected tho).

You *can* get a false positive for Autoshoot, but that should be very rare.\
It is possible to trigger a false positive if you use "bind mwheeldown/up +attack", as scroll (for some reason) does perfect 1-tick input.\
That said, if someone has to go out of their way to do something stupid and abnormal to get a ban, they've basically asked for it.\
If this is a problem for you, you can set `lilac_aimbot_autoshoot` to `0`.

Important thing to note about Autoshoot, because this feature shoots for you, you cannot tell if someone is using Autoshoot by spectating them, or through STV demos. Autoshoot isn't visible in demos or for spectators.

**Q: What is Anti-Duck-Delay? There are so many bans for it, are they false positives?**\
A: Are they false positives? In short: **No.**\
Anti-Duck-Delay (Most commonly called **FastDuck**) is a cheat feature in CS:GO that is available in a LOT of cheats.\
In fact, Anti-Duck-Delay is so commonly used by cheaters, that most bans issued by Lilac in CS:GO will be for this.\
Anti-Duck-Delay works by inputting a value into your usercmd buttons, that is impossible to input by legit players; only internal cheats can do this.

I understand if this makes you anxious, since there are a LOT of bans for ADD, but this is completely normal.\
If someone gets banned for this, they were cheating.

**Q: What is NoLerp?**\
A: "NoLerp" is when cheats set their interpolation to 0ms (or lower than the minimum possible).\
This is often done to increase their Aimbot accuracy.

**Q: What are Angle-Cheats?**\
A: Angle-Cheats is when a player's view angles are set beyond the limits of the game.\
This is often done to create a desync between their model and hitbox, making it harder to shoot them.\
It can also be done to execute some other exploits; like in TF2 with Duckspeed.

Note: Lilac currently does not check for yaw, so some desyncs are still possible and not detected.

**Q: Are Macros cheats?**\
A: No.\
Macros are just when a player is using a script to input buttons for them (AutoHotKey for instance), or by using scroll to spam some input.\
This is why Macro detections can only ban for 15 to 60 minutes, and no more.\
Macro detections are by default disabled, because most servers don't care about this.

**Q: Does Lilac ban for high ping?**\
A: Not quite.\
The optional high ping kicker (which is disabled by default) in Lilac bans players for 3 minutes, after that, they can reconnect.\
The reason for this is simple, if you only kicked high ping players, they could instantly reconnect.

## Non-Steam versions / CS:S v34 / CS:S v91 / ETC...
Non-Steam versions (IE: Cracks) **ARE NOT SUPPORTED!**\
I am sorry to say, but non-steam versions aren't supported.\
This is because of technical problems with cracks, as they tend to be of older versions of the game, which means they'll have bugs that can conflict with some cheat detections.\
And I just don't want to support piracy.\
I also just don't want to download sketchy unofficial cracked versions of games...

So Little Anti-Cheat may not work out of the box for cracked versions of games.\
That said, I've decided to be a little helpful based on feedback from others.

For Non-Steam/Cracked version of CS:S (like v34 or v91), Angle-Cheat detections won't work.\
You can fix this by updating these ConVars: `lilac_angles 0` and `lilac_angles_patch 0`.\
These **HAVE** to be disabled.
