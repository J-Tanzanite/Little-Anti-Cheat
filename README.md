# Little Anti-Cheat

Little Anti-Cheat is a free and open source anti-cheat for source games, and runs on SourceMod.\
It was originally developed for some secret servers I had back in the day.\
But, as I quit cheating and quit having servers, I decided to release this project to help the community out.\
This Anti-Cheat is by no means perfect, and it is bypassable to some extent, but it should still be a nice alternative (or just complementary) to SMAC (SourceMod Anti-Cheat).

### Current Cheat Detections:
 - Angle-Cheats (Legit Anti-Backstab (TF2), Basic Anti-Aims and Duckspeed).
 - Chat-Clear (When cheaters clear the chat).
 - Basic Invalid ConVar Detector (Checks if clients have sv_cheats turned on and such).
 - BunnyHop (Bhop).
 - Basic Projectile and Hitscan Aimbot.
 - Basic Aimlock.
 - Anti-Duck-Delay/FastDuck (CS:GO only).

### Misc features:
 - Angle-Cheats Patch (Patches Angle-Cheats from working).
 - Max Interp Kicker (Kicks players for attempting to exploit interp (cl_interp 0.5)).
 - Max Ping Kicker (Kicks players for having too high ping (Disabled by default)).
 - Backtrack Patch (Patches backtrack cheats (Disabled by default)).

### Supported Games:
 - [TF2] Team Fortress 2
 - [CS:GO] Counter-Strike:Global Offensive
 - [L4D2] Left 4 Dead 2
 - [L4D] Left 4 Dead
 - [DoD:S] Day of Defeat: Source

### Untested, but should work in:
 - [CS:S] Counter-Strike:Source
 - [HL2:DM] Half-Life 2:DeathMatch

## Non-Steam versions / CS:S v34 / CS:S v91 / ETC...
Non-Steam versions (IE: Cracks) **ARE NOT SUPPORTED!**\
It seems like a few people have tried to use Lilac on cracked/non-steam versions of Counter-Strike:Source, and have reported bugs.\
I am sorry to say, but non-steam versions aren't supported.\
This is because of technical problems with cracks (as they tend to be of older versions of the game) and the fact that I don't want to support piracy.

I'm sorry, but Little Anti-Cheat will not work for cracks/non-steam versions.\
And support will never come from me officially.

The same goes for other games, non-steam / cracks aren't supported.

But at least you can add or improve on the translations already provided.\
My friends who did some of the translations were told by me that the translations don't have to be perfect.\
Just understandable to those who don't speak English too well.
